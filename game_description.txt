So_long is a 42 project where a game must be built in C language, using MLX Graphics library. As every 42 project we must accomplish this project, based on the school norms and requirements.
I had the chance to deepen my C language knowledge, and so far it was the project i liked the most to work on.
It is a simple game, where a map must be read, with the required elements, such as the wall, the path way, collectables, a player and an exit. The bonus part would include "enemies" aswell. Player cannot meet
enemy, otherwise player will loose life. Player starts with 100% life, and after each player/enemy encounter, player looses 10% of life. If player life reaches 0, the game will end and exit.
About the textures, i added the particularity of the collectable be a 5 escudos coin, which was one of the coins Euro precedents. As my 5 year-old son is a Buzz Lighteer fan, i decided to have Buzz personage as
the player and Zurg as the Enemies.
This game can be configured to automatically read 32, 48 and 64 images. The bigger, the higher resolution.
On screen player movements counter, number of collectables to be collected and player life can be visualized.
Player can only leave game when there are no items left to collect.
