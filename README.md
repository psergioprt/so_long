So_long - 42 Project

So_long is a game developed in C as part of the 42 curriculum, utilizing the MLX Graphics library. This project adheres to the rigorous norms and requirements set by the school, providing an excellent opportunity to deepen my knowledge of the C programming language. It has been one of the most enjoyable projects I've worked on so far.
Game Overview

The game features a simple yet engaging concept. The player must navigate through a map that includes essential elements such as walls, pathways, collectables, a player character, and an exit. The objective is to collect all items and reach the exit without losing all of your life points.
Key Features:

##▶️ Dynamic Map Reading: The game reads a predefined map that includes walls, pathways, collectables, and an exit.
###▶️ Enemies (Bonus Feature): In the bonus version, enemies are introduced. If the player encounters an enemy, they lose     10% of their life. The game ends if the player's life reaches 0.
####▶️ Custom Textures: The collectables are represented as 5 escudos coins, a nod to the pre-Euro currency. The player        character is Buzz Lightyear, and the enemies are represented by Zurg, inspired by my 5-year-old son's love for the     character.
#####▶️ Image Scaling: The game supports 32x32, 48x48, and 64x64 pixel image sizes, offering higher resolution for larger       images.
######▶️ On-Screen Information: The player can see their movement count, the number of collectables left, and their current      life percentage. The player can only exit the game after collecting all items.

This project has been a fantastic experience, allowing me to blend creativity with technical skills while adhering to the educational standards of 42.
